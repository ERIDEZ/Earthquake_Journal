# Earthquake Journal

Web Mapping

In this project, I was able to map diverse earthquakes happening around the world with the United States Geological Survey API. With the use of Leaflet and D3, I had to place markers by identifying them in the JSON output file and creating an interactive layer ontop of my map. The information is updated each time the site is reloaded, featuring the first 150 earthquakes happening around the globe during past week.

With the help of a scatterplot over the map, the magnitude of the tremors is easily identified.

A Mapbox API Key is needed for the correct operation of these scripts.
