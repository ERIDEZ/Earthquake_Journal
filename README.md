Web Mapping

In this project, I was able to map diverse earthquakes happening around the world with the United States Geological Survey API. With the use of Leaflet and D3, I had to place markers by identifying them in the JSON output file and creating an interactive layer ontop of my map.

Keep in mind that for the correct use of this workspace, a Mapbox API Key is needed.
